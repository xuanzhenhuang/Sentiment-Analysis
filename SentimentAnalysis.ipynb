      "('This film really disappointed me The acting is atrocious Unbelievable And its about actors The story is incredibly obvious A group of independent actors stage a Passion Play and in turn they start to live out the lives of the characters they play Ive been watching a lot of movies lately thanks to Netflix and this is the first one I havent watched all the way through in a long time I felt I didnt need to see the end we all know the end of this story For some it seems this modernization of the Gospels is either sacrilegious or enlightening I cannot speak to any of this as I wasnt raised in the Christian church That being said I was raised in the US and I live in an increasingly Christian culture Im curious enough about Jesus and about the modernization of the religion for better or worse I havent seen Mel Gibsons version but Im guessing that those who liked that one will like this except for the most conservative I just wish this was a better film Lots of these reviews praise Arcands direction and especially the cinematography I liked neither The film itself is rather prudish and preachy I didnt believe the characters personae and I was never involved with their on screen lives The play within the play is very much dated and would not I think carry its own weight in a real time production But thats beside the point What I really needed for this to work would have been stronger development of the characters and the plot to support the philosophical and theological questions the film would like to be about And the musical choices are obvious and unoriginal There were two examples of this that come easily to mind Firstly there is a reenactment of the parable of Jesus driving the money lenders from the temple the lead actor who has fallen for the woman who will play Magdalene and who is also a model and dancer becomes enraged that she must debase herself by auditioning for a commercial with a wicked producer and plenty of panting men in the audience with her pants off He trashes the place and chases them all out I guess this is the level that the film wishes to reach The romance between these two is entirely arbitrary and not at all emotionally realized and the scene is played out like a highschool rendering of Death of a Salesman ie not well Please stop hitting me over the head with this highhanded significance The other is the relationship between the other female lead and the priest who has asked them to do the play and who eventually turns against them and betrays them to the nowadayscorrupt Church Why Why does she sleep with this guy It brings him so much pleasure and me so little pain Ah the saintly whore and the lovable old coot It seems to be just enough for Arcand to signify but not worth the trouble to enrich and enliven these characters They are going through the motions and Im reaching for the eject button Feel free to write me off as bored jaded or just not interested Feel free to watch this movie and see the Passion in all its beauty sadness and inspiration delivered as an amateurish and gimmicky charade Feel free to have all your preconceived ideas affirmed and see any shred of artistic integrity forsaken for monotonous drivel But dont say I didnt warn you', 0)\n",
